# Ex.No.10
Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Date: 17.11.25
## Reg. No : 212223050013

## Aim

To demonstrate how various prompting techniques—such as query decomposition, decision-making prompts, semantic filtering, chain-of-thought prompting, role prompting, and structured prompts—can be applied to create high-quality content including reports, articles, case studies, and creative works using ChatGPT or similar AI models.

## Objectives

To understand the impact of different prompt patterns on content generation.
To analyze how prompt structure affects clarity, coherence, and creativity.
To generate multiple forms of content (report, article, case study, creative text) using different prompting strategies.
To compare and evaluate the outcomes of each prompt technique.

## Tools Used

ChatGPT / GPT-based AI model
Web browser

## Theory
Prompt engineering refers to the method of designing inputs so that AI systems generate effective and relevant outputs. Various patterns exist in prompt engineering:

## 1. Query Decomposition Prompting

Breaking a complex task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.

### Example Prompt:
“Break the following task into sub-questions and answer them step by step…”

### Effect:

Produces structured, logical content
Reduces ambiguity
Improves depth of analysis

## 2. Decision-Making Prompting

Used when selecting options or choosing among alternatives.

### Example Prompt:
“Evaluate the pros and cons and decide the best option with justification…”

### Effect:

Enhances critical reasoning
Generates well-supported arguments

## 3. Semantic Filtering

Used to filter responses based on tone, style, or relevance.

### Example Prompt:
“Provide only technical details. Exclude storytelling and emotional language.”

### Effect:

Ensures relevance
Maintains required writing tone

## 4. Role Prompting

Assigning a role to the model (e.g., editor, engineer, doctor, writer).

### Example Prompt:
“You are a professional report writer. Create a detailed analysis…”

### Effect:

Produces more domain-specific writing
Improves consistency

## 5. Template or Structured Prompting

Providing a strict structure or format.

### Example Prompt:
“Write the report with the following sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusion.”

### Effect:

Ensures organization
Produces standardized documents

## 6. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Encouraging the model to reason step-by-step before answering.

### Example Prompt:
“Think step by step to solve this…”

### Effect:

Increases accuracy
Useful for analytical tasks

# Procedure

Open ChatGPT or any GPT-based model.
Choose a content type (report, article, case study, creative comic).
Prepare multiple prompt patterns for the same content.
Apply each prompt to the AI model and collect outputs.
Compare the generated content for quality, coherence, tone, and structure.
Document how prompt changes affect the output.
Create the final experiment report summarizing observations.

# Sample Outputs Using Different Prompt Patterns
## A. Report Created Using Role + Structured Prompt

### Prompt:
“You are a technical report writer. Write a report on Water Conservation in Smart Cities with Introduction, Need, Technologies Used, Challenges, and Conclusion.”

### Output Summary:

Clear structure
Professional tone
Technical depth

## B. Article Created Using Query Decomposition

### Prompt:
“Break the topic AI in Healthcare into sub-topics and write a detailed article.”

### Output Summary:

Highly organized
Divided into diagnosis, treatment, risks, ethics
Easy readability

## C. Case Study Using Decision-Making Prompt

### Prompt:
“Present a case study on a manufacturing company choosing between automation options. Include decision factors and final reasoning.”

### Output Summary:

Realistic scenario
Strong justification
Good analytical structure

## D. Creative Output (Comic Story) Using Semantic Filtering

### Prompt:
“Write a short comic-style story about a robot hero. Keep it humorous and light, exclude serious or violent content.”

### Output Summary:

Fun, creative tone
Controlled style
Stays within constraints

## Observations

Structured prompts gave the most organized and professional output.
Role prompting improved tone and domain accuracy.
Query decomposition improved clarity and detail.
Semantic filtering effectively controlled writing style.
Creative prompts produced highly imaginative content when fewer restrictions were given.
Minor changes in wording of prompts produced major differences in output quality.

# Result

The experiment successfully demonstrated how various prompting techniques can be used to generate diverse forms of content. Different prompt structures significantly influence coherence, depth, creativity, and style of AI-generated outputs. Prompt engineering is essential for obtaining high-quality content from AI systems.

# Conclusion

Effective content creation using AI is highly dependent on the prompt patterns used. By applying structured prompting, query decomposition, semantic filtering, decision-making patterns, and role prompting, it is possible to generate high-quality reports, articles, case studies, and creative works. Understanding prompt engineering enhances productivity, creativity, and control over AI-generated outputs.
